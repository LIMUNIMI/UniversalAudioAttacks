# Adversarial robustness evaluation of feature learning models and universal audio representations
Source code for the paper "Adversarial robustness evaluation of feature learning models and universal audio representations".

## Setup
Use conda and the environment files provided as specified:
* hearPipeline: for the **Model_import** notebook.
* attackPipeline: for the **Main_Loop** notebook.

## Notebooks
* **Dataset_import**: Download, import and decompress the HEAR tasks and datasets.
* **Resample**: Resample the audio files to target sampling rates.
* **Model_import**: Import the HEAR models, compute and evaluate the embeddings.
* **Main_Loop**: Perform the attacks, evaluate and present the results.
* **SVM**: Perform the SVM-based detection of adversarial examples and present the results.

## Results
The results are presentend in the notebooks.  
For a direct access the two zip files contain the final results for the Attack and SVM phases.
